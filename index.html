  <h2><strong style="font-size: xx-large;">ABOUT ME</strong></h2>
  <p style="font-size: larger;">My name is <strong>Caileigh</strong>. I grew up in an area a few miles outside of Aloha, Oregon with my three brothers and countless animals. I currently live in Vancouver with my boyfriend, three dogs, chickens and fish. I haved worked in management with Costco for the last 7 years and I am ready for a career change that is aimed more towards the things I love to do. I am the go-to person in my warehouse when a spreadsheet, schedule or any computer problem is needed. I enjoy solving problems and have always been <em>fascinated</em> with how computers work. I am excited to expand my programming knowledge and start a new career that I love. </p>
